# CPP_Demo_Game

##### This demonstration game comes to show a simple shooter game concept.
##### It is by no means a finished project, but more of a demo of this idea.
##### The player operates in a single level with 2 mannequins coming to drain their health. 
##### The player needs to keep distance and score points by shooting at them, one will always come very close, and the other keeps a small distance (i.e. can be "pushed").
##### The player can recharge their health and gain a speed boost by picking up the spinning power up.
##### The game demonstrates first person movement, shooting (pre-made ball physics so that is the only thing I cannot take credit for), ready-made royalty-free mesh objects placement, scaling and rotation, objects from primitives created and textured by me, as well as correct face drawing so the lighting hits every object from the proper angle to create smooth shading, AI movement, collision detection, and basic gameplay elements such as health, points, and game over detection.

#### [!!!] Please note: A known bug is that the ball might not fire correctly (freezes in one place). To make sure it works in game, shoot it while in the menu (before hitting Enter to start). [!!!]
